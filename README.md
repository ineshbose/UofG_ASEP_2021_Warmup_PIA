# Warmup Process Improvement Activity

Hello, team. This repository will be used for a warmup PIA (final PIA to follow). This is required from me as a coach of your team as per ASEP Coursework, and beneficial to you and your dissertation in Team Project.

The outcomes for this activity are:
* Getting comfortable with the main programming languages of your project - Python & JavaScript
* Using and understanding Git
* Improve collaboration and code review / discussion

## Task

You may or may not have direct access as a team member to **this** repository, however you should be able to create issues and fork the repository. This activity involves solving some problems ([kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))) in JavaScript on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

Create an issue to start with, for yourself, with the title "Add [your name]'s activity", also **choosing the right issue template** which should be filled in appropriately. This is essential, and will be used for the merge request you'll create for this repository.

Once this issue has been created, clone/fork the repository and **add a new directory** with your GUID (`1234567x/`), and treat that as a root for a new repository - meaning add a `README.md` and `.gitignore` in there. These should be appropriately populated. The README should have the `h1` title as your name, and then rest of the sections (in `h2`) would be for each kata that you do which will have further sub-sections (in `h3`) Problem (explain what the problem description asked you to do) and Solution (explain your solution). You have been told about [Ignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) and you can refer to a [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

After solving the problems and adding all correct files (files named `kata_N.js`/`kata_N.py` where `N` is number, copying solutions you put on Codewars copied to a file), commit and push the changes onto your forked repository, and **create a merge request to this one using the template** for the description. Go to [Merge Requests](-/merge_requests) of the fork, and click "New merge request" with this repository as the *target*. Be sure to link your issue to the merge request. When the merge request test passes, this activity is complete and you can expect a code review afterwards. **Do not worry if you feel your code is not working or passing all tests - that is not the priority.**
